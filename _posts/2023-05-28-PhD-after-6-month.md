I'm back with a new blog post after a year of silence! A lot has happened since then, including my admission to a PhD program in computer science at the University of Surrey.

My PhD is a joint project between Imperial College London and University of Surrey, so I'm affiliated with both institutions. It's an exciting and challenging opportunity for me.

My research topic is about developing a novel algorithm to analyse brain tumour spatial transcriptomics sequencing data. This is a cutting-edge field that can reveal the molecular heterogeneity of tumours and their microenvironment as well as the mechanism behind the treatments done in our lab. I'm still working on finding the best approach for this problem.
